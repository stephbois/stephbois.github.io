## Case Studies and Group Projects
### Business Analysis Case Study Presentation: Group Project 
**[Presentation and project files: View Files]**(insert link here) <br />
**Project Aim:** Conduct data analysis of the "Bank Marketing Dataset" to help Portuguese Bank solve a business problem: To devise a strategy to sell long-term deposit accounts.  <br />
**Tools Used:** Python and Weka files, Tableau, Zoom (for presentation and team communication) <br />
**Summary of Role and Responsibilities:** <br />
This project required that we demonstrate an ability to identify and understand the data and the research question (identifying which customers are most likely to subscribe to a long-term deposit account). 

Collaborated with two other team members
I assisted in analyzing the distribution of numeric attributes and determining whether the dataset has an imbalanced class distribution. I used python and Weka file to conduct predictive modeling and apply a Train Test Split prior to generating a decision tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms for baseline and filtered data based on selected features. Outputs of the algorithms were analyzed and compared based on their performance measures. Results were summarized using Tableau to draw conclusions. Findings and effective business recommendations were communicated in a 7 minute PowerPoint presentations.

### Python Programming for Data Analysis: Group Project

**Project Aim:** <br />
**Tools Used:** Python, Google Collab <br />
**Summary of Role and Responsibilities** Role and Responsibilities: The Algorithm Developer (Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist) responsible for implementing efficient algorithms to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.
Created a Python-based data analysis algorithm using Google Collabs to process, analyze, and visualize a given "Superstore Orders" dataset as part of a team of three students. My role and responsibilities as the "Algorithm Developer (Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist)" involved implementing efficient algorithms to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights. This included using my knowledge of python programming to implement an algorithm to identify the top 10 store sub-categories by sales and designing a data structure to store the monthly sales trend for the entire superstore. I also implemented a search algorithm to find all days where a promo led to sales above a certain threshold. I also designed a scenario where a Stack or Queue data structure would be helpful in processing or analyzing the dataset. Lastly, I reviewed and optimized my code for memory efficiency and time efficiency.

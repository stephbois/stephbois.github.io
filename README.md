## Case Studies and Group Projects
### Business Analysis Case Study Presentation: Group Project 
**[Presentation and project files: View Files]**(insert link here) <br />
**Project Aim:** Collaborate in teams of 3 to conduct data analysis of a "Bank Marketing Dataset" and help solve a business problem (To devise a strategy to sell long-term deposit accounts).  <br />
**Tools Used:** Python and Weka files, Tableau, Zoom (for presentation and team communication) <br />
**Task Summary:** <br />
- Identified the research question (which customers are most likely to subscribe to a long-term deposit account)
- Analyze the initial dataset attributes and performed data cleaning. 
- Split data into train and test sets and applied to Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
- Analysed results of algorithm on basleine data and select features, and interpreted results of their performance measures. 
- Summarized results with visualizations produced in Tableau to communicated findings and business recommendations in a short and concise PowerPoint presentations.

### Python Programming for Data Analysis: Group Project 
**[Jupiter notebook and project files: View Files]** (https://github.com/stephbois/stephbois.github.io/tree/main/assets/projects/python/group_assignment_1) <br />
**Project Aim:** <br />
**Tools Used:** Python, Google Collab <br />
**Summary of Role and Responsibilities** Role and Responsibilities: The Algorithm Developer (Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist) responsible for implementing efficient algorithms to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.
Created a Python-based data analysis algorithm using Google Collabs to process, analyze, and visualize a given "Superstore Orders" dataset as part of a team of three students. My role and responsibilities as the "Algorithm Developer (Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist)" involved implementing efficient algorithms to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights. This included using my knowledge of python programming to implement an algorithm to identify the top 10 store sub-categories by sales and designing a data structure to store the monthly sales trend for the entire superstore. I also implemented a search algorithm to find all days where a promo led to sales above a certain threshold. I also designed a scenario where a Stack or Queue data structure would be helpful in processing or analyzing the dataset. Lastly, I reviewed and optimized my code for memory efficiency and time efficiency.

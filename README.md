## Case Studies and Group Projects

### XML Data Engineering, Information Retrieval, and Data Mining Analysis Group Project 
**[Jupiter notebook and project files: View Files]** (link comming soon) <br />

**Project Aim:** Collaborate in a team of three as the Data Mining Analyst to process and analyze electronic product data in XML format, utilizing XML data handling, information retrieval, and data mining techniques to extract meaningful insights and improve business decision-making towards forming marketing strategies. <br /> 

**Tools Used:** BaseX GUI, RStudio, XQuery, XPath <br />

**Responsibilities**
- Applied Apriori algorithm to grocery transaction dataset, using frequent itemsets with 0.2 minimum support.
- Generated association rules for three-item sets with 0.5 minimum confidence, highlighting significant patterns.
- Analyzed association metrics to interpret strong rule associations using confidence and support.
- Created detailed reports documenting data mining processes, including manual calculations and logic.
- Generated business insights from data analysis to inform and improve decision-making processes.
- Assisted team with writting parsing, querying, and transforming XML data using XPath and XQuery.
- Applying text pre-processing techniques includingn normalization and stemming/lemmatization to standardize text data.
- Assisted in creating a TermDocumentMatrix and defining the granularity of term and weighted measures in accordance with analysis objectives.


### Python Programming for Data Analysis: Group Project 
**[Jupiter notebook and project files: View Files]** (https://github.com/stephbois/stephbois.github.io/tree/main/assets/projects/python/group_assignment_1) <br />

**Project Aim:** Collaborate in teams of three as the Data Structures and Algorithm Specialist to implement efficient algorithms in Python using Pandas library that process, analyze, and visualize a “Superstore Orders” dataset, resulting in the extraction of meaningful insights into the business’ sales and operational trends. <br /> 

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas Library, Google Collab <br />

**Responsibilities**
- Created a Python-based data analysis algorithm using Google Collabs to process, analyze, and visualize a given "Superstore Orders" dataset
- Implemented an algorithm to identify the top 10 store sub-categories by sales
- Designed a data structure to store the monthly sales trend for the entire superstore
- Created a search algorithm to find all days where a promo led to sales above a certain threshold
- Designed a scenario where a Stack or Queue data structure would be helpful in processing or analyzing the dataset. Lastly, I reviewed and optimized my code for memory efficiency and time efficiency. 

### Business Analysis Case Study Presentation: Group Project 
**[Presentation and project files: View Files]**(Link comming soon) <br />

**Project Aim:** Collaborate in teams of 3 to conduct data analysis of a "Bank Marketing Dataset" and help solve their business problem to devise a strategy to sell long-term deposit accounts.  <br />

**Tools Used:** Python and Weka files, Tableau, Zoom (for presentation and team communication) <br />

**Responsibilities**
- Identified the research question: Which customers are most likely to subscribe to a long-term deposit account?
- Analyzed the initial dataset attributes, performed data cleaning, and identified trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Split data into train and test sets and applied Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
- Analysed and interpreted the algorithms’ performance measures, considering the business’s needs.
- Summarized and presented results for stakeholders in a PowerPoint presentation, using visualizations produced in Tableau to communicate clear and concise findings and business recommendations.

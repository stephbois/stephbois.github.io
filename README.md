*Tools Used:* <br />
*Responsibilities:* <br />

The final group project (worth 40% of the final grade) is a collaborative project in which
student groups will apply fundamental data analysis and machine learning skills learned in
this course. In small groups, students will take the role of data scientists to solve a data
analytics problem for an organization. Each group will be able to choose a dataset from a
given list of publicly available organizational datasets to work with.
The first milestone of this project will be for each group to establish their workload
distribution, select one of the provided datasets, and determine a tentative methodology of
their research.
This project will not only allow students to apply what they have learned throughout their
course of study, but also foster valuable teamwork and communication skills.

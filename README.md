## Case Studies and Group Projects
### Business Analysis Case Study Presentation: Group Project 
**[Presentation and project files: View Files]**(insert link here) <br />

**Project Aim:** Collaborate in teams of 3 to conduct data analysis of a "Bank Marketing Dataset" and help solve a business problem (To devise a strategy to sell long-term deposit accounts).  <br />

**Tools Used:** Python and Weka files, Tableau, Zoom (for presentation and team communication) <br />

- Identified the research question: Which customers are most likely to subscribe to a long-term deposit account?
- Analyze the initial dataset attributes and performed data cleaning. 
- Split data into train and test sets and applied to Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
- Analysed results of algorithm on basleine data and select features, and interpreted results of their performance measures. 
- Summarized results using visualizations produced in Tableau to communicate findings and recommendations in PowerPoint presentations.

### Python Programming for Data Analysis: Group Project 
**[Jupiter notebook and project files: View Files]** (https://github.com/stephbois/stephbois.github.io/tree/main/assets/projects/python/group_assignment_1) <br />

**Project Aim:** As a Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist, collaborate with team members to implement efficient algorithms that analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.<br /> 

**Tools Used:** Python, Google Collab <br />

**Summary of Role and Responsibilities** Role and Responsibilities: The Algorithm Developer (Data Structures and Algorithms Specialist) responsible for 
- Created a Python-based data analysis algorithm using Google Collabs to process, analyze, and visualize a given "Superstore Orders" dataset
- Implemented an algorithm to identify the top 10 store sub-categories by sales
- Designed a data structure to store the monthly sales trend for the entire superstore
- Created a search algorithm to find all days where a promo led to sales above a certain threshold
- Designed a scenario where a Stack or Queue data structure would be helpful in processing or analyzing the dataset. Lastly, I reviewed and optimized my code for memory efficiency and time efficiency.
